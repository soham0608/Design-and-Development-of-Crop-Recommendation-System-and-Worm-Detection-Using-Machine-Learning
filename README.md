# Design-and-Development-of-Crop-Recommendation-System-and-Worm-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
The Crop Recommendation System and Worm Detection project was developed to assist farmers in making data-driven decisions about crop selection and pest management. The primary goal was to improve agricultural productivity by leveraging machine learning to recommend optimal crops based on environmental factors and to detect worm infestations early.

Working 

1. Worm Detection Module: 
Input: Images of crops captured using cameras or sensors. 
Processing:The images are processed using image processing techniques to enhance clarity and remove noise.The processed images are then fed into a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.The CNN model analyses the images to detect the presence of worms or pests on the crops.
Output: Identification of crops with worm infestations along with the location and severity of the infestation. 

2. Soil Analysis Module: 
Input: Soil samples collected from agricultural fields along with relevant parameters such as moisture, pH, and 
temperature. 
Processing: The soil samples and parameters are pre-processed to remove inconsistencies and outliers.The preprocessed data is then used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.The SVM model analyses the soil characteristics to determine soil health and composition.

4. Crop Recommendation Module: 
Processing: The soil analysis report is processed to extract key insights regarding soil health and composition.These insights are used as input features for a recommendation engine.The recommendation engine utilizes machine learning algorithms to suggest suitable crop options based on the soil analysis. 
Integration: The three modules are integrated into a cohesive Agricultural Management System.Farmers or agricultural experts can input data (images for worm detection or soil samples for analysis) into the system.The system processes the input data through the respective modules and provides actionable insights and recommendations.Users can access the system through a user-friendly interface, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding crop management and pest control strategies.
